# Simple Slackbot

## Register this SlackBot

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and Register a new Slack bot on the Jeff Slack Workspace.
2. Give the bot a name (you can change it later).
3. Copy the OAuth token and paste it into a new file in your project called `.env` Make sure you add this file to a `.gitignore` file so it's not tracked in GitHub! This is a secret token that should not be shared, otherwise you could lose control of your app.

## Setup your app

1. Create a new project folder with your apps name (and git repository to track your version history).
2. Run `npm init` to start a new node project.
3. Create a new JS file to house your application.
