# Working with Arrays

## Lists, Lists, Lists

Working with arrays (lists) is one of the more common tasks in a job of a programmer, and knowing how to iterate through, sort, and manipulate a list of items is an important skill. For this homework assignment, you'll be introduced to a few of the more common array methods (built-in functions) you're likely to use or see used in the wild.

- [`.filter()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter): method **creates a new array** with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
- [`.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map): method **creates a new array** populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
- [`.sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort): method sorts the elements of an array _in place_ and returns the sorted array. 

## Mutative Methods vs Non-Mutative Methods

When you see a method described as "mutative" or values as "mutable", it means it changes the original value versus returning a new one. This is especially common with array methods.

### Why does this matter?

Well, when variables and functions are defined, the JavaScript interpreter stores their values in memory space it sets aside during the "creation phase" of what's called the "execution context". Some array methods will refer to the same block of memory and change (mutate) the value inside it instead of creating a new block of memory and returning a new array.

That may seem efficient for performance and storage, BUT what if another part (or many parts) of an application relied on that original value, or another developer assumes the value hasn't changed? It could mean a troubleshooting headache later, or _produce negative side effects._

> ðŸ’¡ It's generally considered best practice to use a non-mutative approach in programming to prevent unexpected results.

Here's a small site that lists JavaScript's array methods and mentions clearly whether it mutates or not. [Does It Mutate?](https://doesitmutate.xyz/)
